# Time-Series-Stock-Markets

DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT:
TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
AND FORE CASTING FOR
STOCK MARKET 

# Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze and forecast stock market trends using time series analysis techniques.
Interns will explore various time series models to understand historical patterns, identify trends and
seasonality, and make short-term or long-term predictions. This project offers real-world experience in
financial data analytics, model development, and result interpretation.

# Project Objectives:
1) Understand time series concepts such as trend, seasonality, and noise.
2) Implement models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM for forecasting.
3) Visualize insights and predictions through dashboards or reports.
4) Evaluate and compare model accuracy.
5) Collect and preprocess historical stock market data.

# Tech Stack & Tools:
1) Python
2) Pandas, NumPy
3) Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
4) Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
5) Facebook Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM)
6) Streamlit/Flask for deployment (optional)

# Dataset:
You may use datasets from Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Kaggle containing historical stock data.
The dataset typically includes Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume values for specific time intervals.
